# Predicting-Air-Pollution-Levels
For this project I use `BechleLUR_2006_allmodelbuildingdata.csv`. This data is an accumulation of GIS land-use characteristics from land-monitoring from the EPA, and in situ NO2 measurements from satellite sensors. The dataset has a large number of feature variables. Hence an important goal is to estimate the subset of features are the most pertinent to the variable predicted 


The goal of this project is to use feature selection methods to find the optimal combination of feature variables that best predict outdoor air pollution using multiple regression models
